# Introduction 
A reverse proxy example using nginx and Docker. We have setup a compose file with 2 applications as a test and a stater kit for anyone to use this.

# Getting Started
TODO: Guide users through getting your code up and running on their own system. In this section you can talk about:
1.	Installation Docker locally
2.	Change directory to `playground`
3.	`docker-compose up -d`
4.	Test using `localhost`

# Change Port 80 mapping in Docker-compose if 80 is in use locally
If your local port 80 is in-use, please change the port mapping on the docker-compose file to the relevant port of your choice
